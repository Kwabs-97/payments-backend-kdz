### Database Population Verification
- Test that exactly 500 freemium subscriptions are created
- Test that exactly 7000 bronze subscriptions are created
- Test that exactly 12000 silver subscriptions are created
- Test that exactly 8000 gold subscriptions are created
- Test that exactly 5000 platinum subscriptions are created
- Verify total number of subscriptions is 32,500

### Plan Schema Validation
- Confirm all plans (freemium, bronze, silver, gold, platinum) are created correctly
- Validate plan price matches specified values
- Check that plan features are accurately represented
- Verify plan status is set to 'A' (Active)

### Subscription Schema Validation
- Ensure each subscription has a unique business_id
- Verify email is generated for each subscription
- Check that plan_id correctly references the corresponding plan
- Validate payment platform details (token, external_id, name)

### Filtering and CSV Export Tests
- Retrieve subscriptions with plan price >= $50
  - Should include silver ($50), gold ($70), and platinum ($100) plans
- Verify CSV export contains correct columns:
  - business_id
  - email
  - plan_id
  - plan_name
  - plan_price
  - payment_platform_name
- Check CSV file generation accuracy
- Validate number of records in exported CSV matches filtered subscriptions

### Edge Case Tests
- Test behavior with empty database
- Verify handling of subscriptions with no plans >= $50
- Check performance with large dataset (32,500 records)
- Validate error handling for database connection issues
